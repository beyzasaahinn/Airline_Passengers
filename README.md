Airline Passenger Prediction Project
This project predicts the number of airline passengers using historical data and machine learning techniques. 
The dataset contains monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is called International Airline Passengers and contains two columns:
Month: The date of each observation in the format YYYY-MM.
Passengers: The number of passengers (in thousands).

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in time series forecasting for airline passenger data.
By using RNN, the model captures the temporal patterns effectively, providing valuable insights into passenger trends.
